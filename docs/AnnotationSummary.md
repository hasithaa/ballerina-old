# Introduction to Ballerina Annotations. 

## Introductions

Ballerina `Annotations` are from of metadata, that attached to a Ballerina construct. By design, Ballerina considers all
annotations as optional, hence A Ballerina Program(Service ?) should be able to run without any annotation. 

Ballerina `Annotations` can be used to annotate following Ballerina constructs.   
 
 * Service
 * Resource
 * Connectors
 * Connections
 * Actions
 * Functions
 * User Defined Types
 * Variables
 

All Ballerina Annotations start with Character `@` (at) and it has following Syntax. 

```
@AnnotationName [ ( PrimitiveValue | "AString"  | key = value [, key = value] )]
```

Here `value` can be one of the followings:
* Primitive value. (i.e. integer, long, float, double, boolean)
* A String. (e.g. "aValue")
* Another Annotation. (This can't be the parent or enclosing annotation)
* An Array of one of the above. (e.g. { "String 1", "String 2" })

E.g:
```
    @AnnotationOne
    
    @AnnotationTwo("Value of two")
    
    @AnnotationThree( keyInt = 1 , keyString = "second value", keyAnnotation = @InnerAnnotation("Inner Annotation Value"))
    
    @AnnotationFour( 
        keyStringArray = { "value 1" , "value 2"} ,
        keyAnnotationArray = {
            @InnerAnnotation( innerKeyInt = 1, innerKeyString = "A String"),
            @InnerAnnotation( innerKeyInt = 1, innerKeyString = "A String")
        }
    )
```

In Ballerina annotations are divided into two categories.

* Documentation Annotations
    - These annotations represent structured meta information about the Ballerina constructs that they annotated.(Similar to
     Java Doc comment.) 
* Config Annotations
    - Config annotations denote additional configuration/behavior instructions for Ballerina runtime.
     (e.g Apply Security, Circuit Breaker, etc) By defining the config annotations for a construct, Ballerina developer 
     can instruct to the Ballerina runtime, to alter default behavior or/and apply Quality of services configuration.

## Swagger 2.0 Support

Ballerina Annotations represent a supper set of Open API Specification 2.0 (AKA Swagger 2.0) format. This allows developers
to Generate a Ballerina service skeleton from a Swagger 2.0 definition or Swagger 2.0 definition from a Ballerina service.
